Notable edits:

in application css, ad these lines:
	
	 @import "materialize";
	 
	 @import "materialize/extras/nouislider";
	 
	 @import "https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons";

These lines tell css to import necessary libraries for material css layouts to run on your rails project, thus implying a dependency on internet connectivity
